What is Roleplay Manager Version 2?
Following the success of RPG Manager Version 1 and the lessons learned along the way its time to expand and improve.

In version 1 we used a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system using custom database tables to hold the information.

WordPress has a inbuilt ability to handle multiple post types. So in version 2 we will integrating with the native Post system and moving on to use Custom Post Types to handle the data.

In addition to this we will integrating the impressive permissions system to create a simple system to manage user access control.

So what will Version 2 include?
Version 2 will be moving beyond just fleet and sim management and moving towards full organisation management.

We are also looking to keep this as open as possible to support different genres.

A full break down of the project and the different aspects will be available soon on the progress page.
